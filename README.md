This full-stack application consists of a frontend (client) developed using React and a backend (server) built with Node.js and connected to a MongoDB Atlas database. 
The application supports various features, including category and product management, user authentication (register, login, logout), and token-based authorization.

#short message 
Sorry for not completely including the client node module features since there was an error uploading the client folder on github
